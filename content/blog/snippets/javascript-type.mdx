Often I need to find what is the type of given variable so I could
decide how to handle it or what methods I may expect. At the same time using
`typeof` is not always the solution we need. For example `typeof []` will return
`object` that is because arrays are extended objects but it's not what we want to get.

There is `Array.isArray([])` that will return boolean but again we need to check for
multiple types.

Function below gonna returning string value of the passed variable:
```js
function type(value) {
  return Object.prototype.toString
    .call(value)
    .replace(/\[object |\]/gi,'')
    .toLowerCase();
}
```

I'm going with `.toLowerCase()` just to not relay on capital latters when comparing types.
After all we are working with exact string matching later on.

Let's write a test about it to be sure that everything is as expected:
```js
describe('type', () => {
  it('should return the correct type', () => {
    [
      ['map', new Map()],
      ['set', new Set()],
      ['weakmap', new WeakMap()],
      ['object', {}],
      ['string', 'Hello'],
      ['array', []],
      ['boolean', true],
      ['number', 5],
      ['function', () => {}],
      ['date', new Date()],
      ['generatorfunction', function* generator() {}],
    ].forEach(([expectedType, value]) => {
      expect(type(value)).toBe(expectedType)
    })
  })
})
```
The test is not very extensiv or cover all posible cases but still - show that in most common cases
it's working.

In the cases where we need to accept for example two or more types, now there is a simple way of checking them
without writing multiple `if`:

```js
function oneOfType(value, types) {
  return (types || []).includes(type(value))
}

const foo = 'must-be-string'

if (oneOfType(foo, ['string', 'array'])) {
  console.log(foo.length)
}
```
