Designing Monorepo as a big project is a challenge. It's a lot of work and a lot of things to keep in mind.
And this is a blog post to help you to keep track of the process. I'm not saying that this is the best way to do it, but I'm trying to keep it simple.
And for good or bad this is a good starting point. This is working for me today and probably will change in the future. As always in
software development things change over night.

I gonna use few Open Source tools to help me automate some of the process but will also modify them in a way to suit my needs.
This as mention above is opinionated view so feel free to experiment with it.

So let's start by defining our expectation and requirements and later on we gonna see how we could achieve them.

### Goals

1. Organize the project as single repository and keep all the code in one place.
2. Link multiple packages in the same repository. So we could split parts of the project in different packages.
3. Keep the code in sync with the main repository. So we could have a single place to change the code and all the packages will be updated.
4. Keep it DRY and reuse as muc as possible.
5. Release packages without the need of releasing everything other package.
6. Automate the process as much as possible. Expect to have easy `Getting started` workflow.

Here are some additional goals that I have for my personal projects. I'm using `NPM` organizations to separate some of the packages so will have most of the time
two or more namespaces.

So I'm splitting them in the following way:
  * Packages related to project that are not suitable anything else. In simple terms for example API package and frontend package (this is super simplified example)
  * Packages that could be reused in other projects and there scope exceed the scope of the main project. For example package dealing with some specific functionality, like
  converting Hex colors to RGBA colors.

And we talk about packages I want to clarify something not all packages will be publish into the NPM repository - and if we think about it a little more - there is no need to that. The goals here is to be able to split the project into a lot small pieces that could be easily understand and truly reused. And in the same time think of them as standalone real packages - with there own semantic versioning, documentation, README, etc. So next time when you need to have the same code to create Linked List you just could
go back and copy your greatest work (or at least the code that you think is the best), without the need to extract the how build/structure.

### Getting started

So both `yarn` and `npm` support workspaces. So we could create a workspace and install all the packages we need. And let the package manager to deal from where he could locate the package.

Documentation:
  * Yarn workspaces: https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/
  * NPM workspaces: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/workspaces


```json
{
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["nextproject", "bdryanovski"]
}
```

In my case `bdryanovski` workspace will be the packages that I want to publish overtime and will be reusable in other projects. This could be one or two packages but it's good way to keep them separated.

So packages in `bdryanovski` will be named like that

```js
import { ConvertHexToRgba } from '@bdryanovski/colors'
```

And inside the `nextproject` we gonna namespace the packages like that

```js
import { Models } from '@nextproject/models'
```


### Projects structure

I gonna talk more here about JavaScript, TypeScript project here but the rules and patterns are valid for any other package. So here are some rules to fallow.

1. Packages must be standalone and should be publishable to NPM (Even if you don't publish them to NPM)
2. All dependencies and version must be mention in the package.json
3. Documentation must be in README.md
4. MONOREPO.md must be in the root of the package (more on this later)
5. Provide few basic commands that Lerna will use to manage the packages. Like `build`, `test`, `start` etc.
6. We gonna consume only build packages. So we could use `yarn link` to link the packages if needed. (In the case of TypeScript we need to build it before we could use it, a bit slow but it's making sure that our code is working)

In the case when we need to work with `ESlint` we gonna create a separate package with eslint configuration and use it in all other packages - this way we gonna force ourself to
use the same rules in all packages.

When it comes to TypeScript my suggestion here is to have a `tsconfig.json` into the root of the project and everything else to extend it. And by extending I'm meaning changing paths or adding additional types.
