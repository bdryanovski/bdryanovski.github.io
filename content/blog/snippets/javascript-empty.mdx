Often the question is is something empty ? And what is empty really? The quick answer is
empty is what we decide to be empty. The function below, the standart Array and Object are just
tested to see if they have entries or keys. But for example boolean and numbers they are not empty
they always have some value, so we decide what value is empty and what not.

So said like that, everything bigger than 0 is not empty, `true` and `false` are empty.

The method below don't handle `Set`, `Map`, `WeakMap`.
```js
function empty(value) {
  return (
    (value === undefined || value === null)
    || (typeof value === 'number' && value <= 0)
    || (Array.isArray(value) && value.length === 0)
    || (typeof value === 'object' && Object.keys(value).length === 0)
  )
}
```

In addation to that we need to add some test to make sure everything will
continue to work:

```js
describe('empty', () => {
  it('should check value and find is it empty or not', () => {
    [
      [true, []],
      [false, [2]],
      [true, {}],
      [false, { foo: 1 }],
      [true, null],
      [true, undefined],
      [false, true],
      [false, false],
      [false, 1],
      [false, 5],
      [true, 0]
    ].forEach(([expectedType, value]) => {
      expect(empty(value)).toBe(expectedType)
    })
  })
})
```
